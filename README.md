# EE4486-Project1
## Synopsis

This project is made for EE4483 course at Nanyang Technological University. This project is implemented in Java 7.

## Problem Statement

Implement TWO different search algorithms to find 𝑥3/5 of any real number 𝑥. Note 𝑥 can be negative number too.

## Approach number 1

In this approach, we first find the cube of the given real number x. After that, we find the 5th root of the result using binary search. 

## Approach number 2

In this approach, we use the exponent/ log property. We first find the log of real number x using the in-built Math.log(double) method. The result is then passed as an argument to built-in exponential function Math.exp(double).

## Installation

Java 1.7+ required. 

## Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line with three integers: x, a and b. x is the real number. a and b are the numerator and the denominator of the power respectively.

## Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #i: y z, where i is the test case number (starting from 1), y and z are the approach 1 & 2 results respectively.
